# NetworkToolkit

RealSpeedTest helps you to find out what bandwidth you actually reach without relying on your ISP on what Bandwith you should get.

## Getting Started

You can download the source and compile the project on your own or simply download one of the releases.


## Inspiration

As of me upgrading my Internet Connection and not reaching the full Bandwith on specific hosts, i wanted to dig deeper and found out that it's not only me not reaching the booked speed.
So the idea was born to create this Toolkit, to allow for everyone to test the internet bandwith on real test data, instead of Speedtests.
